  place: "Cresta Oasis Hotel"
  service: true
  speakers: [6]
  description: "I am an advocate of the idea that Africans should develop and export open source software. I also like to lead by example: I am the main author of Reahl, a full-stack web framework that allows you to write a web application using Python only, and on a high level of abstraction.

Reahl is a risky experimental project rethinking the way web frameworks can work.

Not everyone would be interested in using the Reahl web framework itself. However during the course of working on Reahl, we have experimented with different ways of dealing with other aspects of a system – aspects that are not tied to the web framework itself. As a result, parts of Reahl can be used in their own right, independently of the Reahl web framework itself. These parts of Reahl are not well known.

I have done talks before on the testing infrastructure we use, but we also have novel ways for dealing with things like:

  - configuration;
  - internationalisation; and
  -database schema migration.
  - In this talk I’d like to explain the component-nature of Reahl programs and how we handle configuration in that environment."
