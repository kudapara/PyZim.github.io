His spare time goes into Reahl (http://www.reahl.org) -- an experiment to try and implement a different way of thinking about web application development. Reahl offers Python classes that allow you to represent a user interface using only Python. Behind the scenes, Reahl makes your Python code work using the normal HTML/CSS/JS/HTTP, but the burden of how to do that is taken care of.
